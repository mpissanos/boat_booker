Boat Booker
================

Boat Booker is a Ruby on Rails web application that utilizes Javascript/jQuery front end components to render events with AJAX. This is a revamp of the previous version which did not utilize Javascript. This project is part of Flatiron Schools Softwre engineering immersive program's portfolio requirements.

I incorperated the Fullcalender gem to display all current and future bookings.

Users have the ability to schedule trips, create clients, create boats, and all CRUD functionality.

Authorization is provided by Devise, and third party login through Facebook is handled by 0auth.

This is a work in progress, as well as a testbed for implementing new features as my skills progress

Boat Booker is a Ruby on Rails web application that utilizes Javascript/jQuery front end components to render events with AJAX. This is a revamp of the previous version which did not utilize Javascript. This project is part of Flatiron Schools Softwre engineering immersive program's portfolio requirements.

I incorperated the Fullcalender gem to display all current and future bookings.
